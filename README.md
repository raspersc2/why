# why?
Terran has access to a variety of sharp, sometimes gimmicky strategies that tend to appear and disappear on 
ladder. This bot is meant as a test opponent that uses those kinds of builds, 
so bots can practice against them. The bot is open source and designed to work with the 
[local play bootstrap docker image](https://github.com/aiarena/local-play-bootstrap).

Suggestions for improving or expanding the builds are always welcome.

Please don’t reupload this bot directly to the ladder. You’re more than welcome, though, 
to use it as a resource or inspiration when creating your own bot.

## builds

The following builds are available (with the possibility of more later):
- MassMine
- Reapers
- BattleCruiserRush
- ThorDrop

## testing
This bot can be downloaded and used for testing via the [local play bootstrap docker image](https://github.com/aiarena/local-play-bootstrap).

The `terran_builds.yml` file can be edited to test against specific builds.
